## The Problem
Little Bird was born directly out of observing an educator's frustrations firsthand. Jill observed a special education coordinator at Roots spending hours of her time trying unsuccessfully to schedule meetings with families, and asked her to coffee in order to learn more. 

We estimate that 40% of IEP meetings happen without a parent present. Increasing parent attendance of these meetings enhances parents' understanding of their child's needs and allow them to have a say in how their children are taught. We believe that parents know their children best, so by empowering them to have a voice in these meetings, we are directly impacting the level and quality of personalization for students. 

Additionally, the Harvard Family Research Project led a study that showed a clear relationship between parent involvement in school and student outcomes. Thus, increasing attendance will also impact student achievement.

Lack of quality connection between home and school is a challenge that affects low-income households disproportionately. Tragically, many times students from these communities are the ones most in need of differentiated support. Improving a parent's ability to attend an in-person meeting will greatly improve the relationship between teachers and families, and thus also improve the "quality of care" these students receive.
